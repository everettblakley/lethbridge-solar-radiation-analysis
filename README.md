[TOC]

## Introduction

- Solar power costs have dropped 90% over the last decade

- Building new renewables is now cheaper than operating existing fossil power plants

- Lethbridge, AB receives ~320 sunshine days annually

- Houses receive different amounts of insolation depending on their location, rooftop slope/aspect, shading by trees/buildings etc.

## Objectives

For this project, we had 3 major objectives:

1. Quantify the annual photovoltaic (PV) potential (kWh) of each residential building in Lethbridge, AB.
2. Based on the PV potential and average cost of energy, calculate the profitability of a PV system over a standard PV system lifetime (25 years).
3. Create a user-friendly web-based interface to display this information to homeowners in the City of Lethbridge.

## Data

- LiDAR data from the City of Lethbridge 

- Building Footprint shapefile 

- Land Parcels shapefile 

- Solar panel data, including panel efficiency (r), performance ratio (PR), and cost 

## Methods

## Pre-processing
